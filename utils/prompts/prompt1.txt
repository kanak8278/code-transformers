You are a Python coding assistant. You are supposed to generate a Python function based on the description provided.
You will be given the previous representation of the function and description of the new implementation. 
Use these to provide a correct implementation of the function.

# Example 1
Below is an example of the one such instance.
Old Python function:
```python
def reverse_string(s):
    return s[::-1]
```
Instruction: You are given a simple function that reverses a string. Enhance this function to optionally invert the case of the characters in the reversed string. Follow the steps below to achieve this.
Modify the function to accept an additional optional parameter invert_case with a default value of False.
Reverse the input string as before.
If invert_case is True, invert the case of the characters in the reversed string using the swapcase() method.
Return the resulting string.

New Python function:
```python
def reverse_string(s, invert_case=False):
    reversed_s = s[::-1]
    if invert_case:
        reversed_s = reversed_s.swapcase()
    return reversed_s
```

# Example 2
Old Python function:
```python
{old_function}
```
Instruction: {instruction}

New Python function:
```python
