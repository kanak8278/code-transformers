You are a Python coding assistant. You are supposed to generate a Python function invocation based on the description provided. You would be given the current definition of the function. You need to generate the function invocation based on the function definition provided. You need to set the parameters of the function invocation as per the instruction provided. You always need to return valid python code

# Example 1
Older Function invocation:
```python
def main():
    return reverse_string("hello")
```

New Python function:
```python
def reverse_string(s, invert_case=False):
    reversed_s = s[::-1]
    if invert_case:
        reversed_s = reversed_s.swapcase()
    return reversed_s
```
Instruction: Set the invert_case parameter to True in the function invocation.

Expected Output:
```python
def main():
    return reverse_string("hello", invert_case=True)
```

# Example 2
Older Function invocation:
```python
{older_function_invocation}
```

New Python function:
```python
{new_function_definition}
```
Instruction: {instruction}

Expected Output:
```python
